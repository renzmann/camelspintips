    <h1>Jurassic Park (Stern, 2019)</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2024-02-18</p>
    <p>Based on code v1.13</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
      The basic idea - get T-Rex and Control room modes as fast as possible to
      cash in big points.  Start Dino paddocks when possible and try to always
      have one running in the background</li>
    <li>
      Depending on the rubber position on a short plunge, try to get to the
      right flipper without qualifying the playfield.  Aim for the "C" shot
      during ball save so that you're making progress
      towards <b>C-H-A-O-S</b></li>
    <li>
      Get the truck facing to the right so that you're heading towards the
      Brachiosaurus paddock.  I like this one when first learning JP since you
      get some extra points off of rescues.  If you're looking to blow the game
      up, take the Gallimimus on the left instead.</li>
    <li>
      Complete <b>M-A-P</b> (shown on the back board above the pops) via any
      solid <b>WHITE</b> shots.  Starting out you just need the <b>P</b> which
      is most easily done via: left ramp -> ski pass (might require a little
      nudge up) -> left ramp to start the dino paddock.</li>
    <li>
      In the paddock, hit the truck enough times to start <b>Feed T-Rex</b>
      hurry-up.  If you're after points, shoot everything <em>except</em> the
      left ramp to cash in some points and build the <b>T-Rex Multiball</b>
      jackpot value.
    <li>Start the multiball on the left ramp, and use it to more safely finish
      the dino paddock
      <ul>
        <li>Make at least one <span class="orange-insert">RESCUE</span> shot</li>
        <li>Shoot one of the two <span class="yellow-insert">SET TRAP</span>
          targets behind the truck</li>
        <li>Shot one of the two flashing,
          roving <span class="yellow-insert">YELLOW</span> shots to capture the dino</li>
      </ul>
      Subsequent dino paddocks will grow in complexity, but still follow this
      basic format. As you get more used to the dino paddocks on JP, you can
      delay using T-Rex Multiball to the second or third paddock, depending
      on how comfortable you are with the machine's setup.  For humongous points
      in T-Rex Multiball, shoot the <span class="red-insert">RED</span> jackpot
      from left to right.  Doing them in this order adds +1x to the following
      jackpot.  The "Supply Drop" target is your add-a-ball, if it's lit.
    </li>
    <li>
      After capturing the Dino, the Control Room is ready.  Shoot it and select
      "System Boot" all the way to the right.  This is the easiest mode to
      complete and is worth a lot.</li>
    <li>
      Shoot two-way "combos" to finish <b>System Boot</b> - just follow the
      lights.  The final shot is at the control room after hitting the three
      two-way combos; so seven shots total to finish the mode.</li>
    <li>
      If you're still alive at this point - prioritize hitting the truck to
      qualify more T-Rex modes and work through them in order if you can -
      Chase, Encounter, Rampage.  You can control which T-Rex event you go into
      via full flips of the truck</li>
    <li>
      For each T-Rex mode, you'll do just fine following
      the flashing lights, but it's worth your time to look up their rules once
      you get a basic feel for them and are consistently reaching these modes</li>
    </ol>
