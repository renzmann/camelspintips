    <h1>Jaws (Stern, 2024)</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2024-02-18</p>
    <p>Based on code v0.84</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Ignore the skill shot and short plunge to the right flipper if possible.
        The idea is to first qualify the playfield with a shot to the boat/shark
        captive ball.</li>
      <li>
        Get at least <em>two</em> hits to the boat/shark.  One to qualify modes,
        and another that serves two purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>Cash in 5M points</li>
          <li>Enable "upgrading" the mode <em>during</em> the mode
        </ul>
        If you don't hit the shark at least once before starting the mode, you
        are locked out of further upgrades to the mode.
      <li>
        If you still have ball save at this point, take a pot shot at the chum
        bucket to light <span class="red-insert">RED</span> inserts that "chum the
        water" (add progress towards <b>Jaws Multiball</b>)
      <li>
        Start <b>Scars</b> on the center 180 ramp.  Follow blue lights to
        complete the mode and red lights to work towards <b>Jaws multiball</b>.
        We take this mode before multiball because hitting stand-up targets
        reduces the mode's value</li>
      <li>
        Once chum is complete, use the 180 ramp to get to the harpoon, since
        this is the easiest and safest shot in the game.  Hit the fin when it
        pops up to qualify <b>Jaws Multiball</b>, indicated
        by <span class="yellow-insert">YELLOW</span> inserts.</li>
      <li>
        Starting <b>Jaws Multiball</b>, hit the chum bucket three times for
        add-a-ball</li>
      <li>
        During Jaws Multiball, prioritize the lookout tower stand-up targets to
        add beachgoers and get to <b>Feeding Frenzy</b></li>
      <li>
        During <b>Feeding Frenzy</b>, hit the stand-ups to score points.  The
        total of Feeding Frenzy is added to your bonus, so it's valuable to get
        this early in the game.</li>
      <li>
        At this point it's safe to just follow the flashing lights.  If you hit
        the right ramp twice to start a bounty hunt, do them in the listed order
        (Mako first)</li>
    </ol>
